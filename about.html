				<p>I rip_indra (also known as Robotmega or Robloxmecha) is a game developer and the co-owner of Blox Fruits, known for several games such as:
Dragon Ball Z: The Ultimate Adventures.
Dragon Ball: Final Adventures.
Knife Simulator.
Titan Simulator.
And lastly, Blox Fruits itself.
The above mentioned games are often developed in teams/groups such as the Roblox group Gamer Robot, a group previously owned by rip_indra (later given to mygame43), as Indra often works with mygame43, Plokster, Norperz, and more. He is known to be close to mygame43, as mygame43 is the co-owner along with Indra on almost every single project/game they have worked on.

In the official Blox Fruits Discord, rip_indra goes by the name Robson, along with mygame43 as Rob. Fun fact: To prevent spam pinging of Rob, the word "rob" is auto-deleted by the Dyno bot in Discord. (They now goes by testcombo and KING_RED_HEAD, respectively.)
